## Getting started/Updating
Run ```npm i``` to install all relevant dependencies. Note that you need node installed.


To host just the popup part of the Chrome Extension, run `npm start`

To get the production build (for testing), run `npm run build` and load the folder into chrome://extensions as an Unpacked Extension (make sure Developer Mode is on)
